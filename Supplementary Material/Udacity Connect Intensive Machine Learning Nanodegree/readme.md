# Supplementary material

All material in this file I obtained from the following two git repos:

* [Yanfei Wu](https://github.com/yanfei-wu/Udacity_connect) 
* [Nicky Pie](https://github.com/nickypie/ConnectIntensive)

They are a collection of Jupyter Notebooks from Udacity Connect Intensive Machine Learning Nanodegree  that you would otherwise not find in the normal Machine Learning nanodegree.
