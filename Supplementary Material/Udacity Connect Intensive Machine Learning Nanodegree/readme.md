# Supplementary material

All material in this file I obtained from the following [github repo](https://github.com/yanfei-wu/Udacity_connect) which is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks from Udacity Connect Intensive Machine Learning Nanodegree.

You will find contained within extra tutorial and practice notebooks that you would otherwise not find in the normal Machine Learning nanodegree.
